Latest Build was created in Unreal Engine 5.0.2

This Project was created during my Gameplay Programming lecture at the University. It was my first try to create a prototype in Unreal with C++. Its not perfect and kinda wanky but I like it anyways. 

The purpose of the lecture was to show the students how a development loop works. To achieve this we created several documents and a prototype. 

First, I needed to pitch my idea to the other students and listen to what they think. With the new input I created a Game Design Document and started to implement the prototype. 

After the first attempt was finished I gave the prototype to other students for play testing. There fore a Playtest Document was needed to describe my intentions, how the prototype works and what the control's are. 

After the other students evaluated my prototype I created an Evaluation Document with all the new inputs, how the test was structured and how to continue. After this I implemented the new features and created a Technical Documentation. The Documents, Code and a Windows Build can be found in the repository.
